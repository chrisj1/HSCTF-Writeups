# Andrew Wiles (Other, 250 points)

Co-written with Ezra Edelman.

We're given no source and a netcat link, and we're told that Keith disproved Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 3. After doing some research, we find that Fermat's Last Theorem states that

```
a^n + b^n â‰  c^n
```

In this case, for n = 3, we're trying to prove that the sum of two cubed numbers (greater than the trivial case of 0) will never equal a third cubed number. Since Keith disproved this, has it been proved before?

Whoops. Since a proof has existed for almost 400 years, there **must be something wrong with Keith's implementation**.
